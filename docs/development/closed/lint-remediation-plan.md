# (Closed) Incremental ESLint Remediation Plan

This document has been archived (2025-08-26) after achieving and verifying 0 lint errors and 0 warnings across the monorepo. See original content in version history for detailed batch logs and methodologies.

Summary of final state:

* All 11 planned steps completed for every package.
* Centralized logger abstraction enforced (`@rpg/utils`).
* No `any`, unsafe operations, or stylistic rule violations remaining.
* Backend & frontend type-check clean.
* Plan matrix fully checked; further lint regressions should start a new plan.

For future work:

* Consider enabling stricter rules incrementally (e.g., prefer-readonly-parameter-types) in a new doc.
* Monitor CI to ensure `--max-warnings=0` gate stays green.
